        As discussed on the previous page many popular basketball opinions are generally false narratives about the game that can be proven wrong by real statistics and facts. The same can be said about the debate between Lebron and Jordan. Another popular misconception about the two is that Jordan is better because he won six rings and never lost in the Finals. This statement in itself makes no sense because this does not make Jordan the better player it makes the Bulls the better franchise.
        As fans of sports we associate the best players with their team but just because the team is the best doesn't mean their best player is the best. For instance, both Lebron and Jordan won 50+ games on multiple occasions with their teams in the regular season but without Jordan, the same Chicago Bulls team still won 52 games the next year. Without Lebron, the Cavs were only 19-82 with the same starting lineup without Lebron. This brings us to the real meaning of the greatest player, the overall impact on a team.</p>

    <div class="text4">
        <p>Lebron has won 4 championships with 3 different teams and Jordan has won 6 with the same team. All of these teams without Lebron James underperformed in every way without him and the Bulls without Jordan were still a Championship contender. This negates the 6-0 rings argument entirely. This and the fact that Mike did not win 6 straight he lost at times in the first round and did not to mention only has played against 9 hall of famers in the NBA finals while Lebron has played over 25.</p>
        
        <p>These are all myths of Lebron and Jordan that officially have been broken down into facts that have been separated from fan opinions. Jordan has won more rings than Lebron and lost less but has played on a better team against weaker competition in the playoffs. He also does not nearly have the impact on a team as Lebron James as he has shown time and time again that he can make any team into an NBA finals contender. These false Narratives about the two great players are misguided fan opinions but when broken down by evidence they are simply untrue.</p>
    
    <p>These myths about the two players are due to false Narratives created by fans. When fans of a sport are worried about their favorite player being surpassed in skill and status they often try and create narratives about them that make them untouchable. These narratives eventually become the norm because other people repeat them so much that all fans believe them however these narratives are biased and not based on anything but who people like better. These myths can be broken down and disproven by facts and true events in basketball history. An example of this demonstrated is the narrative that Jordan's 6 rings make him the best and Lebron always loses but this fails to mention the levels of competition they faced and the strength of the franchises they played for. False narratives in basketball are biased to fit the needs of a group or individual's favorite player but can be disproven by evidence of what really happened.</p>
