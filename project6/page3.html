    Now that you understand the bases of the argument a little more I want to continue to help you get perspective on this topic. If you still believe Michael Jordan is better than Lebron James as an Individual (now that we have distinguished the difference between the greatness of an individual and the greatness of a team) then what if I told you that almost every stat would prove you wrong? Lebron scores almost as many points a game while rebounding, passing, and shooting 3-pointers much better. While the 2 may be close in scoring defense and personal accolades Lebron is levels ahead of in other aspects of the game. Specifically clutch shooting, rebounding, and passing. This is the reason his impact on the game is so much greater than Jordan's and why he is able to win with any teammates. This part is also due to the fact that in some ways he is a bigger stronger Michael Jordan with a better basketball IQ. Lebron is listed at almost 6 10 260 and Jordan was listed at 6 6 220. Lebron can run faster is stronger and can jump just as high as Michael Jordan with a similar (and in some ways better) skillset. So you tell me who would you pick: a bigger player who can do more or a smaller player who is arguably only slightly better at one thing but is nowhere near as advanced in other areas.</p>

    The research on this website was used to crack down on the popular misconceptions about basketball and MJ vs LBJ. Now that you fully understand the argument of who is better “Lebron or Jordan” I challenged you to change your take on who You believe is better. If you still think Jordan is better, what does he do that Lebron hasn’t proven he’s better at If you already believe Lebron was the GOAT, use the research from this page to challenge your friends on what they think and prove them wrong.

<p>Basketball is a very complex game and even more difficult to understand when discussing who is the best player. Like most sports basketball is full of fan bias and false narratives about the world's favorite superstars but when we take a look at numbers and facts not opinions we can tell who is actually better without putting much thought into it at all.</p>
