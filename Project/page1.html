    <h1>Lebron The greatest Player?</h1>

   
   
    <p>I know why you're here and what you're thinking. You're probably with your friends somewhere and got into the same old argument you always get into about “who’s better Lebron or Jordan” and still don’t know how to make your case on how they’re wrong. You know Lebron is better than Jordan but need help explaining it because of how complex the game of basketball really is. They constantly see it all the time but don’t fully understand the argument because they are stuck in a basketball ideology that is based on fan opinions and not facts. And even If you can’t change this person's opinion on who's better I can help you give them perspective on why their Jordan vs Lebron argument just doesn't make sense.My goal for anyone who visits this website is for them to better understand the context behind the debate and basketball itself. Before we can talk about who’s better let's talk about the new rules of basketball.

    <p>The Basketball that Michael Jordan played vs the basketball Lebron played is drastically different. The most important thing to understand when talking about who is the best player is what it was like to score in the 90s (when Michael Jordan played most) and after 2000 (The present). One of the biggest reasons Mike is considered the greatest player is because of a popular misconception about the present and past defensive rules of basketball and his scoring. Mj was considered the best scorer of his time and on multiple occasions has scored 40, 50, and even 60 points. Lebron is considered one of the best scorers of the present but only has scored 60 once. But how is this possible ? Lebron consistently shoots higher percentages than Jordan. Only 32 players have scored 60 points and only 12 of them have played in the modern NBA. This is because the narrative that scoring was harder in the 90s is false.</p>

    <p>In the 2000s a new rule was implemented which allows zone defense; prior to this you could play more physically but you could not “help” guard anyone except your match-up. This means that if you were the better player you were free to torch them all game with nobody else to stop you unless the matchup was switched. It’s much harder to score on 2 players than 1 aggressive defender and that’s why zone and not man is the base defensive system of all coaches. This is what generally makes modern scorers better such as Lebron (being the best) because they cannot be stopped by multiple people. Imagine if only one power forward had to defend Lebron by himself without help. A young Lebron would have 50 to 60 every night. This simple rule change has made a huge impact on the game so how could Mj be better playing against easier defense?
