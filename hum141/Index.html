            <h1>United States Wealth Inequality <br> By Sharif Bey</h1>
            <h2>In our current society there is more wealth inequality than ever before and it has gotten significantly worse in the last 100 years. As of 2022  three multibillionares have more overall wealth than the entire bottom of 160 million Americans 45 percent of new income goes to the top 1% of people and CEOs make 350 times more than their average workers. This is a problem that needs to be addressed but how?</h2>
          
            <div class="top"> <p>We need to redefine what we consider wealth inequality if we ever wish to have an equal distribution of wealth, huge gaps like this between rich and poor are oppressive and lack ethics.</p></div>

       <div class="article"> <p>Hello, My name is Sharif Bey and I am excited that you have visited this page to talk about a pressing economic and social issue in the united states that concerns me and I am hoping to spread awareness to everyone who clicks on this website. The problem I am currently addressing is that the distribution of wealth throughout the country is unequal. This is a worldwide issue but in order to create solutions to this problem I would like people to observe it in America first and then think about its impact on the rest of the world. Although having a poor rich and middle class is inevitable in a capitalist society I am specifically addressing the way money is disturbed by race gender ethnicity and social economic background. </p>
       
        <br> 

      <p>The point I am making is in countries where people can choose the way in which they make money and their income is not controlled by the government there should not be one group of people who controls all of the wealth while minority groups only have the bottom percentage of it and are much more unlikely to be in the upper class of income. I hope by reading this article you understand the problem of wealth inequality in hopes that one day we will find a way to make a more equal distribution of wealth between classes. The richest people should not control the majority of the money in an economy while working and lower-class people only make fractions of the money they should be earning and at times struggle to support themselves and their families. </p></div>

    <p>The next page will examine graphs from the World Inequality database describing the current economic state of the pretax national income of two different groups. The first graph will be on the income of the top 10 percent of people vs the income of the bottom 50% of Americans. The Second Graph will be on the Top 10 percent of earners vs the income of adult women. I hope by taking a look at these numbers you will redefine the way you examine wealth in the united states and see that the distribution of money through classes lacks equity and fairness.</p>
