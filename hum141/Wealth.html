    <h1>Graphs of Inequality:</h1>
    <br> <p>These graphs will help you understand the current state of the countries wealth inequality so that there can one day be change. Only once awareness of an issue is spread can there be change. There is more data that could be talked about when examining wealth ineqaulity but these 2 graphs where made to encourage you to want to do more research on this topic you and want to create change and not tell you everything you need to know.The propose of my webpage is to spread awareness to encourage further education to create change and not to tell people what needs to be done. Women and middle class citizens  are also  not the only groups of people negatively impacted by wealth inequality. I would just like to focus on these 2 groups of people because I believe when change comes for women and the middle then it will make things easier for people with even lower income than average middle class citizens and people of different races religions and different cultural backgrounds to obtain equality in the distribution of wealth in the united states.Take a look at the data from these graphs they will you understand that minorites are siginfiacntly  more poor than the upper middle class and the upper middle class controls most of the countries economy.

    <p> I hope this helped changed your perspective on the distribution of wealth in the united states  minorities like women deserve to make more money and the gap between classes is to large to be considered true equality.</p>
